> Your primary button to smash! Your Basic Attack Move does what is
> labelled on the can. Attack.

### ✊ Charged Attack Move

> **Also does damage. It requires charging. Sometimes it fails. But it does even more damage.**
> 
> Charge this baby up and fire a real knock out punch!

### ❤️ Heal Move

> **Sometimes the damage is too much. Heal for more health!**
> 
> Realistically, pretty pointless. But hey it's there.
